# Overview

The Renesas Flash Programmer (hereafter referred to as the RFP) is software that uses an E1 emulator (hereafter referred to as the E1), E20 emulator (hereafter referred to as the E20), E2 emulator (hereafter referred to as the E2), E2 emulator Lite (hereafter referred to as the E2 Lite), or J-Link Debug Probe  (hereafter referred to as the J-Link) via a serial, USB or SWD interface to erase, write, and verify programs on a target system on which a Renesas Electronics MCU with on-chip flash memory is mounted.

This document describes the command line options for manipulating the RFP on Linux, Windows and macOS.

The range options determine the range for erasure.  
If the target device does not support this function, this option is ignored.

## -program, -p
Erases the range for writing to the device and writes to the device.  
The specified hex file and range options determine the ranges for erasure and writing.  

The following options can also be used to write data:

## -verify, -v
Verifies the data that have been written to the device.  
The range for verification is the same as that for the `-program` option.
